# Project Paradox Chrono

This is a personal project that showcases a game I have worked on called Paradox Chrono. The Game is built using a mix of visual studio ID and unit game engine, and it's a vibrant 3D platformer with many different levels, using blender I also created custom assets for the game.

# Getting started

To run this project locally, you'll need to have the Unity Game engine installed on your computer. Once you have these installed, follow these steps:

1. Copy the files into a folder.
2. Navigate to the cloned Folder and open it via Unity Hub .
3. Run it.
4. and you should then be able to see it on your screen.
